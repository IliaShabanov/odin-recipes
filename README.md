# odin-recipes
In this repository I'll be keeping the first project of mine - a little site with some recipes of Georgian cuisine. It's definitely going to be improved even further by using CSS later. Good luck to me:)

This project is the indicator of my understanding of what I've studied about HTML, especially:

1) Write the template for any HTML file
2) Use different HTML elements, such as "p", "strong", "em", "h1-6", "ul" and "ol" and some others
3) Add hyperlinks and images to the site
4) Create and use repos for the projects
