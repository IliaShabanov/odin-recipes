        <p>There is no denying that sampling the delicious dishes and flavours that comprise Georgian cuisine is one of the highlights of visiting this South Caucasus nation and, in fact, Georgian food can be just as much of a draw to the country as its beautiful mountains and historic cities.</p> 
        <p>Firmly cementing itself as a foodie destination, Georgian cuisine is one of the last “discovered” culinary scenes in Europe and the food and flavours are really something to celebrate.</p>
