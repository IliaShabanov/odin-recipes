    <h2>Adjika Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>For a recipe for Georgian cuisine adjika, wash red hot peppers, string on a thread and hang dry. Do not dry the pepper completely, it should be slightly wrinkled. Drying time can take 3-7 days, it all depends on how ventilated the room is. Cured peppers do not have a pronounced peppery aroma and combine very well with spice aromas.</li>
     <li>When the pepper has dried up, remove from the thread and twist it together with the garlic through a meat grinder twice. Before twisting, the pepper can be peeled from the seeds. If you nevertheless decide to grind the pepper in a mortar, then pepper and spices, garlic and salt are put into the mortar. It is rubbed all at once into one mass, if the pepper is dry, you can add a small amount of water, practically sprinkle it.</li>
     <li>Grind coriander, dill, fennel and fenugreek seeds in a mortar or grind with a coffee grinder. If all the spices can be easily ground in a mortar, then it is better to grind fenugreek in a coffee grinder, it is very dense and it is almost impossible to grind it. Mix the twisted peppers and garlic with spices, add salt and place tightly in a sterilized jar. Adjika is best kept in small 200-250 g jars, as it is easier to remove and less fading.</li>
