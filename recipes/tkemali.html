        <p>Tkemali Sauce â€“ a recipe for a classic Georgian cherry plum sauce with lots of greens. Sweet and sour tkemali in combination with hot pepper create a unique Caucasian taste and aroma of tkemali sauce. The only problem in the tkemali sauce recipe is ombalo, which is not available in most regions.</p>
        <p>You can try replacing ombalo with peppermint and savory. Of course, tkemali cooking without ombalo will differ from the original Georgian tkemali sauce, but tkemali sauce will still be very tasty.</p>
